# GraphRAG System

A Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation system that enhances traditional RAG with knowledge graphs.

## Features

- **Document Ingestion**: Parse and extract entities from documents
- **Knowledge Graph**: Build and traverse knowledge graphs
- **Vector Search**: Semantic similarity search using embeddings
- **Hybrid Retrieval**: Combine graph traversal with vector search
- **LLM Integration**: Generate responses using retrieved context
- **REST API**: Production-ready API endpoints

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Development

This project is being developed using CC_AUTOMATOR4.
