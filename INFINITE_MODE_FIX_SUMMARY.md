# Infinite Mode Fix Summary

## Problem
The `--infinite` flag was not truly infinite. It only affected phase retry attempts (how many times to retry a failed phase) but did NOT remove turn limits within each phase execution. This caused test phases to fail at exactly 30 turns despite running in "infinite mode".

## Root Cause
The SDK options in `phase_orchestrator.py` were using hardcoded `phase.max_turns` values from `PHASE_CONFIGS` (ranging from 15-50 turns) without checking if infinite mode was enabled.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Turn Limits Override (CRITICAL FIX)
**File**: `src/phase_orchestrator.py:541`
```python
# Before:
max_turns=phase.max_turns,

# After:
max_turns=999999 if self.infinite_mode else phase.max_turns,  # Override for infinite mode
```

### 2. Message Buffer Extension
**File**: `src/phase_orchestrator.py:552`
```python
# Before:
max_messages = 500  # Limit message history to prevent memory leaks

# After:
max_messages = 10000 if self.infinite_mode else 500  # Extend buffer in infinite mode
```

### 3. Typecheck Stagnation Tolerance
**File**: `src/file_parallel_executor.py:404-410`
```python
# Before: Always break after 3 stagnant iterations
if stagnant_iterations >= 3:
    print(f"ðŸ›‘ Breaking infinite loop - same errors persist after {stagnant_iterations} attempts")
    break

# After: Allow more attempts in infinite mode
if stagnant_iterations >= 3 and not self.infinite_mode:
    print(f"ðŸ›‘ Breaking infinite loop - same errors persist after {stagnant_iterations} attempts")
    break
elif stagnant_iterations >= 10 and self.infinite_mode:
    # Even in infinite mode, break after 10 stagnant iterations to prevent true infinite loops
    print(f"ðŸ›‘ Breaking after {stagnant_iterations} stagnant iterations (infinite mode safety)")
    break
```

## Testing
Run the ML Portfolio Analyzer test again with:
```bash
cd /home/brian/cc_automator4
./run_ml_portfolio_test.sh
```

The test phase should now be able to run beyond 30 turns if needed to complete all unit test fixes.

## Verification Script
Created `tools/debug/test_infinite_mode_fix.py` to verify settings are properly applied.

## Notes
- Phase timeouts (600s) are still in place but V3 SDK manages its own timeouts
- WebSearch timeout (30s) is legacy and bypassed by V3 SDK
- Even in infinite mode, we maintain safety limits (10 stagnant iterations) to prevent true infinite loops
