# Test Phase Instructions
- Use subagents to find existing test patterns
- Follow the project's test conventions
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Keep tests focused and fast

## Milestone 2 Success Criteria:
- Working main.py that runs technical analysis and displays results
- Modular technical indicator library (MA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
- Signal generation system with configurable parameters that can be tested
- Pattern recognition for common chart patterns
- Backtesting framework for strategy validation with runnable examples
- Performance metrics calculation (Sharpe ratio, max drawdown)
- Clean interfaces between indicators and signal generators
- Comprehensive test coverage for all calculations
- Working CLI for running technical analysis accessible from main.py
