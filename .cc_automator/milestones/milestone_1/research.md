   - Async data fetching with proper error handling

2. **Data Processing**:
   - DataPipeline class orchestrates data sources
   - Validation using Pydantic models (StockPrice, MarketData)
   - Transform pipeline for data normalization
   - Error handling and retry logic

3. **Storage System**:
   - Repository pattern for data access abstraction
   - Models for market data persistence
   - Caching layer for performance optimization
   - Time-series data querying capabilities

4. **Configuration Management**:
   - Environment variable-based configuration
   - Structured config classes with dataclasses
   - Runtime validation and warnings for missing config
   - Support for different environments

5. **CLI Interface**:
   - Three main commands: `fetch`, `search`, `analyze`
   - Rich console output with formatted tables
   - Proper error handling and user feedback
   - Help system and command documentation

### Architecture Quality
- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns with distinct layers
- **Dependency Injection**: Services are injected rather than hardcoded
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling at all layers
- **Testing**: Full test coverage with unit, integration, and API tests
- **Documentation**: Well-documented code with type hints and docstrings
