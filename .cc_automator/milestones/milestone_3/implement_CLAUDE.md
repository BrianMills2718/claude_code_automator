# Implementation Phase Instructions
- Follow the plan exactly - don't add extra features
- Only implement what's needed for Milestone 3
- Use subagents to verify your work
- Keep code simple and readable

## Milestone 3 Success Criteria:
- Working main.py that demonstrates ML risk assessment and portfolio optimization
- Risk factor modeling using multiple ML algorithms that can be tested
- Feature engineering pipeline for market data
- Model training and validation framework with runnable examples
- Portfolio optimization using modern portfolio theory
- Risk-adjusted return calculations
- Model persistence and loading system
- A/B testing framework for model comparison
- Working API endpoints for risk assessment accessible from main.py
