# Research Findings - Milestone 1

## Current State
- main.py exists with basic hello world functionality
- No calculator implementation present
- Empty src/ directory

## Requirements Analysis
For basic arithmetic operations, we need:
1. Calculator class with add, subtract, multiply, divide methods
2. CLI interface to interact with calculator
3. Input validation and error handling
4. Unit tests for all operations

## Approach
- Create src/calculator.py with Calculator class
- Update main.py to provide CLI interface
- Implement error handling for division by zero
- Follow type hints throughout
```

## Issues Observed in Current Output

1. **Zero Cost Display** - The async execution doesn't capture costs properly
2. **Generic Session IDs** - Shows "async" or "unknown" instead of real IDs
3. **Polling Messages** - Verbose 15-second interval messages
4. **No Parallel Execution Indication** - Even when parallel is enabled
5. **Missing Error Details** - Failures don't show underlying errors
6. **No File-Level Progress** - Can't see which files are being processed

## File Parallel Execution Output (when enabled)

```
[4/9] LINT Phase
🚀 Using file-level parallelization for lint fixes

Analyzing files for linting...
Found 5 Python files with F-errors

Executing parallel lint fixes:
  Worker 1: src/calculator.py (3 errors)
  Worker 2: src/utils.py (1 error)
  Worker 3: tests/test_calculator.py (2 errors)
  
Results:
  ✓ src/calculator.py - Fixed 3/3 errors [$0.08]
  ✓ src/utils.py - Fixed 1/1 errors [$0.04]
  ✓ tests/test_calculator.py - Fixed 2/2 errors [$0.06]
  
✓ Phase lint: completed
  Total Cost: $0.18
  Total Duration: 1.8s (3.2x speedup)
```

This demonstrates the current system's verbosity and information gaps that could be improved.
