# V3 Stability Validation Gates

**Purpose**: Define concrete criteria that must be met before any V4 development begins  
**Status**: V3 currently "working with caveats" - not yet meeting stability gates

## Executive Summary

V3 is currently **NOT ready** for V4 development. While basic functionality works, significant SDK stability issues remain unresolved. These gates must be passed before considering V4 features.

## Critical Stability Issues to Resolve

### 1. TaskGroup Race Conditions (BLOCKING)

**Current State**: ❌ **FAILING**
```
RuntimeError: Attempted to exit cancel scope in a different task than it was entered in
BaseExceptionGroup: unhandled errors in a TaskGroup (1 sub-exception)
asyncio.exceptions.CancelledError: Cancelled by cancel scope
```

**V3 Current Approach**: Error masking instead of fixing
**Required**: Actual fix of underlying async cleanup issues

**Validation Gate**:
- [ ] WebSearch operations complete without TaskGroup errors
- [ ] Complex tool operations complete cleanly
- [ ] No async cancel scope warnings in logs
- [ ] Proper cleanup of all async resources

### 2. SDK Cleanup Robustness (BLOCKING)

**Current State**: ❌ **MASKING ERRORS**
**V3 Strategy**: "Classify as cleanup noise and ignore"
**Required**: Clean async resource management

**Validation Gate**:
- [ ] All streaming operations complete with proper cleanup
- [ ] No async cleanup exceptions in any scenario
- [ ] Resource cleanup verified under stress conditions
- [ ] Memory leaks eliminated in long-running operations

## Stability Validation Tests

### Gate 1: Consecutive Success Test
**Requirement**: 10 consecutive ML Portfolio Analyzer runs without SDK errors

**Current State**: ❌ **NOT TESTED**
**Test Procedure**:
```bash
# Run this 10 times in a row
for i in {1..10}; do
  echo "Run $i of 10"
  cd example_projects/ml_portfolio_analyzer
  python ../../cli.py --infinite
  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "FAILURE: Run $i failed"
    exit 1
  fi
  echo "Run $i completed successfully"
done
echo "SUCCESS: All 10 runs completed"
```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] 10/10 runs complete without crashes
- [ ] No TaskGroup errors in any run
- [ ] No async cleanup exceptions
- [ ] All evidence files created correctly
- [ ] Resume functionality works if interrupted

### Gate 2: Resume Functionality Validation
**Requirement**: Resume must work reliably from any phase interruption

**Current State**: ⚠️ **PARTIALLY TESTED**
**Test Procedure**:
```bash
# Test resume from different phases
python cli.py example_projects/ml_portfolio_analyzer --timeout 5  # Force timeout
python cli.py example_projects/ml_portfolio_analyzer --resume     # Should continue

# Test resume with different interruption points
# - During research phase
# - During implementation phase  
# - During test phase
# - After partial milestone completion
```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Resume works from any phase interruption
- [ ] No duplicate work performed
- [ ] Progress tracking accurate after resume
- [ ] Evidence files preserved correctly
- [ ] Session state properly restored

### Gate 3: Infinite Mode Stress Test
**Requirement**: 8+ hour continuous operation without failure

**Current State**: ❌ **NOT TESTED**
**Test Procedure**:
```bash
# Long-running stress test
timeout 8h python cli.py example_projects/large_project --infinite
```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Runs for full 8 hours without crashes
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable (no leaks)
- [ ] No SDK error accumulation over time
- [ ] Progress tracking remains accurate
- [ ] Can be cleanly interrupted and resumed

### Gate 4: Resource Usage Validation
**Requirement**: Stable resource usage under normal operation

**Current State**: ❌ **NOT MEASURED**
**Test Metrics**:
- Memory usage: Should not exceed 500MB for typical project
- File handles: Should not leak file descriptors
- Network connections: Should properly close API connections
- CPU usage: Should return to baseline between phases

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Memory usage stable over time
- [ ] No file descriptor leaks
- [ ] Clean network connection management
- [ ] CPU usage returns to baseline between operations

### Gate 5: Error Recovery Validation
**Requirement**: Graceful handling of all error scenarios

**Test Scenarios**:
- Network interruption during API calls
- Disk space exhaustion during file operations
- Invalid project configurations
- Corrupted checkpoint files
- Missing dependencies

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Clear error messages for all failure modes
- [ ] No data corruption during failures
- [ ] Proper cleanup of partial operations
- [ ] Recovery possible after error resolution

## SDK Issue Resolution Requirements

### TaskGroup Error Elimination
**Required Actions**:
1. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify exact async context management issues
2. **Proper async/await patterns**: Fix cancel scope handling
3. **Resource cleanup**: Ensure all async resources properly cleaned
4. **Testing**: Verify fixes under stress conditions

### WebSearch Integration Stability
**Current Issue**: WebSearch operations trigger TaskGroup errors
**Required Fix**: Proper async subprocess management for web operations

### Streaming Message Processing
**Current Issue**: Cleanup happens in different tasks than initialization
**Required Fix**: Consistent async context management throughout streaming

## Validation Timeline

### Phase 1: Issue Resolution (2-3 weeks)
- [ ] Fix TaskGroup race conditions
- [ ] Implement proper async cleanup
- [ ] Resolve WebSearch integration issues
- [ ] Add comprehensive error logging

### Phase 2: Stability Testing (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] Run consecutive success tests
- [ ] Validate resume functionality
- [ ] Perform stress testing
- [ ] Measure resource usage

### Phase 3: Validation Confirmation (1 week)
- [ ] Independent verification of all gates
- [ ] Documentation of stability evidence
- [ ] Approval for V4 development consideration

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Gates
- **Consecutive Success Rate**: 10/10 runs without SDK errors
- **Resume Success Rate**: 100% from any interruption point  
- **Memory Stability**: <10% growth over 8 hours
- **Error Rate**: 0 TaskGroup errors in stress testing

### Qualitative Gates
- **Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error reporting
- **Debugging**: Easy root cause identification
- **Maintenance**: Stable operation without intervention
- **Documentation**: Complete evidence of stability

## Current Status Assessment

**Overall V3 Stability**: ❌ **NOT READY FOR V4**

### Passing Criteria
- [x] Basic functionality works
- [x] Cost tracking and message parsing
- [x] Error classification system
- [x] Phase execution completes

### Failing Criteria
- [ ] TaskGroup errors eliminated
- [ ] Async cleanup working properly
- [ ] WebSearch operations stable
- [ ] Long-term stability proven
- [ ] Resume functionality validated
- [ ] Resource usage stable

## V4 Development Prerequisite

**MANDATORY**: All stability gates must pass before any V4 development begins.

**Risk**: Building V4 features on unstable V3 foundation will:
- Amplify existing SDK issues
- Create complex debugging scenarios
- Potentially corrupt the working parts of V3
- Waste development effort on unstable base

**Recommendation**: Focus exclusively on V3 stability until all gates pass. Only then consider V4 improvements.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Ongoing Stability Monitoring
- Weekly consecutive success tests
- Monthly stress testing
- Continuous resource usage monitoring
- Error rate tracking over time

### Regression Prevention
- Automated stability tests in CI/CD
- Gate validation before any V3 changes
- Performance regression testing
- Memory leak detection

### Documentation Requirements
- Complete stability test logs
- Error resolution documentation
- Performance baseline measurements
- Maintenance procedures

## Conclusion

V3 requires significant stability work before it can serve as foundation for V4. The current "working with caveats" status is insufficient for production use or as basis for more complex features.

**Priority**: Fix V3 stability issues first, validate thoroughly, then consider V4 development.
