# Integration Test Phase

## Tasks
1. Check if tests/integration directory has test files
2. If needed, create integration tests that verify component interactions
3. Run: `pytest tests/integration -xvs`
4. Fix any failing tests

## Focus Areas
- Test interactions between modules
- Verify main.py integrates with other components
- Test error handling across boundaries
- Minimal mocking - test real interactions

## Evidence Required
Show pytest output with all tests passing.
