# CC_AUTOMATOR3 Project Setup Guide

I'll help you set up your project for automated development. I'll analyze your project documentation and ask clarifying questions to properly configure the automation.

## Step 1: Project Analysis

First, let me examine your project structure and any existing documentation.

**Actions I'll take:**
1. Read README.md and any other documentation files
2. Analyze existing code structure (if any)
3. Look for requirements files or dependency lists
4. Check for existing tests or specifications

## Step 2: Information Gathering

Based on my analysis, I need to gather the following information:

### Basic Information
1. **Project Name**: What is the official name of your project?
2. **Project Description**: Please provide a 2-3 sentence description of what your project does.

### Technical Details
3. **Technical Requirements**: 
   - What programming languages/frameworks are required?
   - What are the key technical constraints?
   - Are there specific versions required?

4. **External Dependencies**:
   - What external services does your project need? (databases, APIs, etc.)
   - Are there any API keys or credentials required?
   - What system dependencies are needed?

### Success Criteria
5. **Success Criteria**: How do we know when the project is complete?
   - What functionality must be working?
   - What performance requirements exist?
   - What quality standards must be met?

### Milestones
6. **Project Milestones**: 
   - Can you break the project into 3-5 major milestones?
   - Each milestone should produce a working version of the software
   - Example: "Milestone 1: Basic CLI with file input/output"

### Environment
7. **Environment Variables**: 
   - What configuration variables does your project need?
   - Format: VARIABLE_NAME: description

### Special Considerations
8. **Special Considerations**:
   - Are there any unusual requirements or constraints?
   - Any specific coding patterns to follow?
   - Any libraries or approaches to avoid?

## Step 3: Validation

After gathering this information, I'll:
1. Show you the filled template for review
2. Verify that milestones are "vertical slices" (each produces runnable software)
3. Confirm all requirements are captured
4. Save the configuration as CLAUDE.md in your project root

## Step 4: Ready to Execute

Once confirmed, the automation system will:
- Execute each milestone through 9 phases
- Maintain complete isolation between phases
- Provide evidence of successful completion
- Create a working, tested application

Please answer the questions above, and I'll help configure your project for automated development. If you have existing documentation, just point me to it and I'll extract what I can!
