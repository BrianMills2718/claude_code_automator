# FastAPI CRUD API

## Technical Requirements
- FastAPI with async/await patterns
- SQLAlchemy 2.0 with async support (NEED CURRENT SYNTAX)
- Pydantic v2 for data validation (BREAKING CHANGES FROM V1)
- JWT authentication with python-jose
- Current library versions and patterns (2024)

## Milestone 1: Basic CRUD API with User model
- Set up FastAPI application structure with latest patterns
- Create User model with SQLAlchemy 2.0 async (current syntax required)
- Implement CRUD endpoints using 2024 FastAPI best practices
- Use Pydantic v2 for request/response schemas (v2 API required)

This requires current library syntax that has changed significantly.
