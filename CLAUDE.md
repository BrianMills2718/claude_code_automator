# ML Portfolio Analyzer - Advanced Financial Analysis System

## Project Overview

Build a sophisticated machine learning-powered portfolio analysis system that combines real-time financial data, technical analysis, risk assessment, and predictive modeling. This system will demonstrate complex architectural patterns, data processing pipelines, and ML integration.

## Technical Requirements

- **Architecture**: Clean separation between data ingestion, processing, ML modeling, and presentation layers
- **Data Sources**: Multiple APIs (Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, economic indicators)
- **ML Components**: Risk prediction, return forecasting, portfolio optimization
- **Storage**: Time-series database for historical data, configuration management
- **API**: RESTful endpoints for portfolio analysis requests
- **UI**: Web dashboard for portfolio visualization and analysis results
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests with mock data
- **Documentation**: API docs, architecture diagrams, deployment guides
