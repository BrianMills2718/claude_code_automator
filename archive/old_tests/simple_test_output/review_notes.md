# Code Review: hello.py

## Code Quality Observations

1. **Clean and Simple**: The code is well-structured with clear separation of concerns - a dedicated greeting function and a main entry point.

2. **Good Documentation**: Both functions have docstrings explaining their purpose, which aids readability.

3. **Proper Entry Point**: Uses the `if __name__ == "__main__":` pattern correctly for script execution.

4. **Consistent Style**: Follows PEP 8 conventions with proper spacing and naming.

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Return vs Print**: Consider having `greet()` return the greeting string instead of printing directly. This would make the function more testable and flexible:
   ```python
   def greet(name):
       return f"Hello, {name}! Welcome!"
   ```

2. **Input Validation**: Add basic validation to handle empty or None values:
   ```python
   def greet(name):
       if not name:
           name = "Guest"
       return f"Hello, {name}! Welcome!"
   ```

3. **Type Hints**: Consider adding type annotations for better code clarity:
   ```python
   def greet(name: str) -> None:
   ```

Overall, this is clean, functional code that demonstrates Python basics effectively.
