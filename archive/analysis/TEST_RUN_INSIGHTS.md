# Test Run Insights - Calculator Project

## What Worked ✅

1. **Context Passing Fix**
   - Research phase: 47.6s (success)
   - Planning phase: 109.2s (success) 
   - Implementation phase: 140.0s (success) - WAS FAILING BEFORE!
   - The full plan is now being passed to implementation

2. **Parallel Execution**
   - Lint + Typecheck ran simultaneously
   - Lint: 32.9s
   - Typecheck: 110.2s (ran in parallel, saved ~33s)

3. **Git Worktrees**
   - Working correctly with initial commit fix
   - No more "invalid reference: HEAD" errors

## What Failed ❌

1. **Test Phase Failure**
   - Test phase: 310.4s, hit 30 turn limit
   - Integration phase: 248.8s, hit 30 turn limit
   - Both trying to create complete test suites from scratch

2. **Context Not Passed to Test Phases**
   - Test phases don't know what was implemented
   - They're working blind, causing loops

3. **Wrong Assumptions in Prompts**
   - "Fix all failing unit tests" - but no tests exist!
   - Should be "Create unit tests for implemented functionality"

## Key Observations

1. **Token Usage**
   - Still loading ALL files for each phase
   - Could be reduced 80%+ with file-level parallelization

2. **Progress Visibility**
   - Can't see what Claude is actually doing
   - Just "Phase running... (15s elapsed)"
   - Need real-time output streaming

3. **Evidence Requirements**
   - Shown repeatedly in terminal output
   - Meant for Claude, not humans
   - Should be filtered from display

## Performance Metrics

- Total execution time: 11m 57s (failed)
- If test phases had worked: ~8-9 minutes estimated
- With optimizations: Could be 3-4 minutes

## Cost Metrics (Not Real Due to Subscription)
- Research: $0.53
- Implementation: Free (cached?)
- Test: $2.67 (failed)
- Integration: $1.94 (failed)

## Next Steps Priority

1. **MUST FIX**: Pass implementation output to test phases
2. **MUST FIX**: Change test prompts to handle test creation
3. **SHOULD DO**: File-level parallelization 
4. **SHOULD DO**: Real-time progress streaming
5. **NICE TO HAVE**: Meta-agent for stuck detection
